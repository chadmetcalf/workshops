## Problem statement

Everyone share their solutions with each other. Compare and contrast different
algorithms that people used and discuss other possible solutions.

### Triangle hints

If you store the three sides as an array, then sort that array can you shortcut
some of the checks for side equality, etc.? If you store the sides as an array
and keep only unique items can you shortcut some of the checks?

### Hamming hints

Can you solve the problem with a reduce statement? What if you turned the two
input strings into arrays, then zipped the arrays?

### Allergies hints

Can you use bit-shifting to generate the bitwise flags instead of manually
hard-coding them?
