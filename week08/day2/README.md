# Solve with memoization

## Problem statement

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even valued terms.

## Goal

Each member should solve the Fibonacci problem on their own computer using
memoization, then profile their solutionâ€™s performance. When everyone is
complete compare, contrast, and discuss the solutions as well as alternatives.

It should be noted that there are different layers of this solution that can be
memoized.
