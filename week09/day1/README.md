# Repeat Speed Kata

## Problem statement

Get a fresh clone the workshop speed test repository. Set a timer for twenty
minutes and solve as many of the problems as possible in the allotted time. The
two simplest problems are hamming and triangle.

## Goal

You can either try to complete more problems than you did in week 9 or try
different problems.
