# Research & Discussion

## Problem statement

Spend the first ten minutes researching a tenant of web scale architecture and
then give a five minute or less lightening talk. Focus on what benefits each
tenant provides to the overall solution and how they support each other. The
tenants are: horizontal scaling, shared nothing, multiple tiers, commodity
hardware, and minimal management.
