# Review Gitflow

## Problem statement

Discuss several Git branching models (sparse tree, Github flow, etc), read an
article about Gitflow, then discuss the merits of Gitflow.

Have the members draw their current projectâ€™s branching strategy. Discuss the
merits and problems with each. Then read and discuss the Git Flow branching
strategy from the discussion points.

## Goal

Understand that Git branching models exist and begin to recognize the classes
of problems they help you avoid.
