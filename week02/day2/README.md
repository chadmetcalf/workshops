# Q&A

## Problem statement

What approach do we take to extending old code?

## Goal

Introduce refactoring as a data-driven, intentional, measurable, and valuable
process.

*	Finish "All the Little Things".
*	Example discussion points:
  * Was value created by refactoring the code?
  * Why was ABC Complexity used as a metric to measure the success of the
    refactor?
  * If your code doesn't have tests how do you trust it?
  * When is the right time to refactor?
