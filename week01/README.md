# Week 1: Welcome

## Organizer Notes

These two sessions are intended to allow early success while also exposing the
participants to something new. If either of these topics are something your
group is doing professionally feel free to change them. During these sessions
you should ask questions to try and get the group talking about the problems,
possible solutions, pros and cons of each solution, or anything else that may
come up that's germane to the problem. Don't allow the conversation to simply
become an extension of the things the participants are doing in their job right
now.
