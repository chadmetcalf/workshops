# Data Munging 2 & 3

Day 1 should be a simple parsing problem. It is very similar to Day 2 from the
previous week and most users will reuse some portion of their code from solving
that problem. This is fine - they will get a chance in day 2 to refactor any
duplication.

Day 2 allows the group to flex their refactoring muscles. The two solutions
should be short and simple allowing for trial and error. If users are unsure
how to proceed have them manufacture a business scenario and refactor them to
meet the requirements of that scenario.
