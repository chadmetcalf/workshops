# “All the Little Things” by Sandi Metz

## Problem statement

What approach do we take to extending old code?

## Goal

Introduce refactoring as a data-driven, intentional, measurable, and valuable
process.

* Introduce the Gilded Rose Kata (skim the README, spend 5 minutes individually
  looking over the existing code with an eye towards extension, 5 minutes
  sharing 1st impression, and predicting the effort and uncertainty of adding
  the new feature).
* Watch the first 20 minutes of All the Little Things (20:07 is a great
  breakpoint).
