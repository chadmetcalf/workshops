# Fibonacci

## Problem statement

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even valued terms.

## Goal

The team should collaborate to whiteboard out a program that will solve the
problem. The specific programming language the team chooses to use is less
important than getting them to work as a group and think about a more abstract
problem. This problem should be solvable by most teams in the allotted thirty
minutes.

## Discussion points

Discuss possible methods of solving the problem including recursion, looping,
memoization, and others. They should discuss the advantages and consequences of
each solution.
