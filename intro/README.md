# Welcome Meeting Agenda

## Organizer Notes

Schedule the meeting for 30 minutes.

This meeting serves the necessary purpose of introducting people to the
program. It is also intended to set the expectation that these meetings will
have a purpose and a quick tempo. When done well this meeting will end very
early. In most organizations this will come as a surprise to most
participants.
