# Speed Kata

## Problem statement

Clone the workshop speed test repository. Set a timer for twenty minutes and
solve as many of the problems as possible in the allotted time. The two
simplest problems are _hamming_ and _triangle_.

These problems all come from Exercism.io. If your organization uses a language
other than Ruby most of these exercises and their tests should be available in
your language of choice.

## Goal

The intention is to get a baseline for this second phase of the Workshops. This
same lesson will occur again on week 11.
