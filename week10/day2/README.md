# Data Munging Refactor

## DRY Fusion

Take the two programs written previously and factor out as much common code as
possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some kind of shared
functionality.

## Kata Questions

* To what extent did the design decisions you made when writing the original
  programs make it easier or harder to factor out common code?
* Was the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?
* Is factoring out as much common code as possible always a good thing? Did the
  readability of the programs suffer because of this requirement? How about the
  maintainability?
